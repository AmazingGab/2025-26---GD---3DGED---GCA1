# 3D Game Engine Development – ToDo List

## Overview
This document contains a step-by-step development plan of MonoGame content covered in class. The work is structured week-by-week and will be developed **live in class** for our custom game engine (`GDEngine`). We will implement a Unity-modeled ECS in incremental milestones. Keep code changes small, demoable, and reversible.

## Goals
- **Unity-parity mental model** (`Scene`, `GameObject`, `Component`, `System`, `Transform`, `Camera`)
- **Deterministic lifecycle** (`Awake` → `Start` → `Update` → `LateUpdate` → `OnDestroy`; `Start` once)
- **Data/behavior split** (`Component`s hold data + narrow local logic; `System`s iterate and act)
- **Functional rendering path** (`MeshFilter` + `MeshRenderer` + `RenderSystem` with WVP)
- **Hot-swappable input** (`KeyboardInput`/`GamepadInput` devices, pluggable receiver via `IInputReceiver`)
- **Pedagogical pacing** (each step compiles and shows visible progress)

## Instructions
- Follow the tasks in order (marked with `[ ]` for incomplete and `[x]` for complete).
- Code is developed interactively in class; update this checklist as we progress.
- Unit tests are implemented in a **separate MSTest project** after the class implementation is stable.
- Each week builds on the previous week.

## Performance & Optimization

---

## Week 4
- [x] Create clean MonoGame `Game` + engine project.
- [x] Add `EngineContext` with `GraphicsDevice`, `Content`, `GameTime`, `SpriteBatch`.
- [x] Add `SystemBase` (`Update`/`Draw` hooks).
- [x] Refactor `EngineContext` to make it a singleton and implement `IDisposable`.
- [x] Add `Camera` with position, forward, up; FOV/aspect/near/far.
- [x] Add `Component` base with `Enabled`, lifecycle hooks, internals for `Awake`/`Start`.
- [x] Add `GameObject` with `AddComponent<T>()`, `GetComponent<T>()`.
- [x] Implement `Transform` (`LocalPosition`/`LocalRotation`/`LocalScale`; `LocalMatrix`; `WorldMatrix`).

## Week 5
- [x] Add `Time` class to support timescale; refactor update methods from `GameTime` to `deltaTime`.
- [x] Parent/child with `Transform.SetParent`, and `Forward`/`Right`/`Up` helpers.
- [x] Convert standalone camera to a `Camera` **`Component`**.
- [x] `Camera.LateUpdate` computes `View`/`Projection` from `Transform`.
- [x] Create `MeshFilter` with `VertexBuffer`, `IndexBuffer?`, `PrimitiveType`, `PrimitiveCount`, bounds.
- [x] Add `MeshRenderer` with `BasicEffect` (`VertexColorEnabled = true`, depth on in renderer).

## Week 6
- [x] Add `LayerMask` in preparation for 1st stage of camera culling.
- [x] Add FBX loading in `MeshFilterFactory`.
- [x] Add some assets for grass and skybox.
- [x] Add `Material` and `RenderState` classes to support multiple effect types.
- [x] Add `ContentDictionary` to store asset references.
- [x] Add keyboard and mouse controllers for `Camera` (`MouseYawPitchController`, simple drive/3rd person).
- [x] Add `AnimationCurve` classes (`AnimationCurve1D`, `AnimationCurve2D`, `AnimationCurve3D`) to support smooth movement along a curve.
- [x] Add `DemoAnimationCurveController` to move a `GameObject` along a user-defined curve.
- [x] Add lit and unlit textured cubes in `MeshFilterFactory`.
- [x] Add perf HUD with FPS, verts, primitives stats (via `PerfStats`).
- [x] Add `RenderSystem` that gathers (`Transform`, `MeshFilter`, `MeshRenderer`).
- [x] Add `RenderLayer` sorting in `RenderSystem`.
- [x] Add **material abstraction**: wrap `Effect` into a `Material` with parameters; pipeline for future shaders.

## Reading Week
- [x] Define `InputState` (`Move`, `JumpPressed`, `Action1`, `Action2`).
- [x] Implement `IInputDevice` + `KeyboardInput`, `GamepadInput`.
- [x] Implement `IInputReceiver` (e.g., `PlayerController` component).
- [x] Add `InputSystem` that routes device → receiver; expose `SetDevice`, `SetReceiver`.
- [x] Add `IDisposable` to core classes.
- [x] Add support for MonoGame effect types in `Material` and `MeshRenderer`.

## Week 7
- [x] Add integer structs (e.g. `Integer2`).
- [x] Add `ScreenResolution` for easy resolution changes.
- [x] Performance improvements (replace `Math.Pow` with direct multiplication) in `Ease`.
- [x] Add `PerfStats` to show FPS, etc.
- [x] Add `Scene::Find` and `Scene::FindAll` for finding `GameObject`s by `Predicate`.
- [x] Add `Main::InitializeModel()` to load FBX models.
- [x] Add **serialization**: simple JSON for spawning `GameObject`.
- [x] Add `UIReticleRenderer` demo to show `UIRenderSystem` in action.

## Week 8
- [x] Improve name formatting on `ScreenResolution` fields.
- [x] Add `WindowUtility` to centre game to prevent annoying drag on open.
- [x] Add **event bus**: lightweight pub/sub (`EventBus`) for decoupled messages between systems.
- [x] Add JSON asset loading support to `ContentDictionary` and move JSON files to `Data` folder.
- [x] Add `NamedDictionary` to support loading assets that don’t use `Content::Load` (e.g. `AnimationCurve`).
- [x] Add `UITextureRenderer` and simple menu demo.
- [x] Rename `UIRenderingSystem` to `UIRenderSystem`.
- [x] Rename `RenderingSystem` to `RenderSystem`.
- [x] Set game window title and change icon.
- [x] Add drivable model with 3rd person `Camera`.
- [x] Add UI support for HUD and menu (`UIRenderSystem`, `UITextRenderer`, `UITextureRenderer`).
- [x] Add MSTests for `Transform` to isolate bugs.
- [x] Re-factor UI renderers to share common fields in parent `UIRenderer`.
- [x] Add other `Camera` controller types (3rd person, rail camera, security).
- [x] Add `AppData` string constants for use in `Main` (e.g. `"The Player"`).
- [x] Add anchoring to `UIRenderer` (see stats overlay in `Main::InitializeStatsRenderer`).
- [x] Add support for single or multi `Camera` views in `RenderSystem`.

## Week 9
- [x] Add `OrchestrationSystem` for sequencing game events.
- [ ] Add physics engine (`PhysicsSystem` and CDCR).
- [x] Add **audio hooks**: `AudioSystem` to support 2D and 3D sound; service access via `EventBus`.
- [ ] Add `UIMenuSystem`
- [ ] Add dictionary in `MeshFilterFactory` to reduce `VertexBuffer` and `IndexBuffer` usage on duplicate calls to a method.
- [ ] Add support for deep and shallow cloning on `GameObject` components.
- [ ] Add support for opaque/transparent objects.
- [ ] Split `GameObject` in `Scene` into opaque/transparent, active/inactive, static/dynamic.
- [ ] Add **frustum culling** with `BoundingFrustum` against `MeshFilter.Bounds`.
- [ ] Add event on resolution change.
- [ ] Add demos for effects supporting normal maps and environment maps.

## Bugs
- [ ] Is `Camera` filtering by `LayerMask`?
- [ ] Can I add multiple overlay `Camera` sorted by depth?
