## 🔍 About The Game

Squash Them All is a game where a child (you) has been left home alone for a good while as your parents are away on holidays. You ignored the chores and didn't take care of the house. Now you face your greatest fear. ROACHES! Your actions had consequences and it's time for you to clean it up. Squash them all before they fully infest your whole house. You have 2 minutes so make it count!

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Spatula layering makes it disappear sometimes.
- Roaches don't turn the way they are moving.
- Everything can walk through walls.
- Roaches sometimes tend to flip over on their side or upside down, some tend to fly up a bit.
- Invisible textures on models.
- Roaches tend to just clip through the ground and fall. (We increased the amount of roaches to still have enough roaches for the player to squash)
- No collision on the map.
- Player can phase through objects.
- Play again button doesn't actually reload the game.
