## About The Game

Squash Them All is a game where a child (you) has been left home alone for a good while as your parents are away on holidays. You ignored the chores and didn't take care of the house. Now you face your greatest fear. ROACHES! Your actions had consequences and it's time for you to clean it up. Squash them all before they fully infest your whole house. You have 2 minutes so make it count!
